Welcome to Vitalus' documentation!

Vitalus is a rsync wrapper. Rsync is a good atomic tool, but it needs to be wrapped to have a real backup solution.
Backup solutions are generally too basic or very difficult. This one fits my needs.

Philosophy
==========
* I want to centralize my backup in a unique script to achieve many tasks.
* I want to backup my desktop on external disks.
* I want to backup external disks to other external disks.
* I want to backup my /home/user on hosts accessible via ssh to a local disk.
* I want to backup my destop to hosts accessible via ssh.
* I want to keep increment if I need it.
* I want to adjust the frequency of copies for each task. The script starts much more frequently.
* I want readable log files telling me if everything goes fine.
* ...

Functionalities
===============
This is just another way to express the philosophy :)

* Manage different tasks
* rsync from and to local disks
* rsync from SSH to local disk
* rsync from local to SSH almost supported
* Check disk space (local disks)
* Keep track of time evolution (increments done with hard links), not possible via SSH for the moment.
* Old increments deleted (keeping a minimal amount of increments)
* Rotated logs (general + one per task)

How to install?
===============

See :doc:`install`.


How to setup?
=============
See :doc:`example`.

In my use case, I have a cron job running every hour. IMHO, this is quite atomic. Then, the script decides which task has to be done.

About ssh
---------
Keys must be configured with an empty passphrase.
Add in your ~/.ssh/config, something like

    Host sciunto.org
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key-empty-passphrase

Source or destination must have the format: login@server:path


Indices and tables
