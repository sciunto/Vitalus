    # It is designed to be run frequently
    # by a cron job (e.g. each few hours)

    # When I want to check my script, I set the log level to DEBUG.
    # This give you a chance to understand what's going wrong.
    # The default is INFO, so WARNING or CRITICAL messages are printed in logs
    # Logs are storred in ~/.backup. They are rotated once a day.

    # This is my external disk
    my_backup.set_destination('/media/disk/backup')

    # I add a job for 'my_documents'
    # I want to keep increments (default: False)

    # Copy data excepting *.html files.
    # This is a rsync filter rule (man rsync to learn more)
    # filter is a tuple. Don't forget the coma.

    # Another job
    # minimal duration between two backups: 5 hours (default: 24h)
